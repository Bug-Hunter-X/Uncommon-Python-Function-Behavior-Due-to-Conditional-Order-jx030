This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in Python function logic that stems from the order of conditions in an if-elif-else chain.  The function `function_with_uncommon_bug` unintentionally returns different results depending on which conditions are met first. This highlights the importance of carefully considering edge cases and ensuring that conditional logic produces the expected outcome across all input scenarios.  The solution file provides a corrected version of the function.
